11. Teacher-made
assessment strategies
Kym teaches sixth grade students in an urban school where most of the families in the community
live below the poverty line. Each year the majority of the students in her school fail the state-wide
tests. Kym follows school district teaching guides and typically uses direct instruction in her
Language Arts and Social Studies classes. The classroom assessments are designed to mirror those
on the state-wide tests so the students become familiar with the assessment format. When Kym is in a
graduate summer course on motivation she reads an article called, "Teaching strategies that honor
and motivate inner-city African American students" (Teel, Debrin-Parecki, & Covington, 1998) and
she decides to change her instruction and assessment in fall in four ways. First, she stresses an
incremental approach to ability focusing on effort and allows students to revise their work several
times until the criteria are met. Second, she gives students choices in performance assessments (e.g.
oral presentation, art project, creative writing). Third, she encourages responsibility by asking
students to assist in classroom tasks such as setting up video equipment, handing out papers etc.
Fourth, she validates student' cultural heritage by encouraging them to read biographies and
historical fiction from their own cultural backgrounds. Kym reports that the changes in her students'
effort and demeanor in class are dramatic: students are more enthusiastic, work harder, and
produce better products. At the end of the year twice as many of her students pass the State-wide test
than the previous year.
Afterward. Kym still teaches sixth grade in the same school district and continues to modify the
strategies described above. Even though the performance of the students she taught improved the
school was closed because, on average, the students performance was poor. Kym gained a Ph.D and
teaches Educational Psychology to preservice and inservice teachers in evening classes.
Kym's story illustrates several themes related to assessment that we explore in this chapter on teacher-made
assessment strategies and in the Chapter 12 on standardized testing. First, choosing effective classroom
assessments is related to instructional practices, beliefs about motivation, and the presence of state-wide
standardized testing. Second, some teacher-made classroom assessments enhance student learning and motivation
-some do not. Third, teachers can improve their teaching through action research. This involves identifying a
problem (e.g. low motivation and achievement), learning about alternative approaches (e.g. reading the literature),
implementing the new approaches, observing the results (e.g. students' effort and test results), and continuing to
modify the strategies based on their observations.
Best practices in assessing student learning have undergone dramatic changes in the last 20 years. When
Rosemary was a mathematics teacher in the 1970s, she did not assess students' learning she tested them on the
