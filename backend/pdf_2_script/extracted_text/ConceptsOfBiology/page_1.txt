CHAPTER OUTLINE
2.1 The Building Blocks of Molecules
2.2 Water
2.3 Biological Molecules
INTRODUCTION The elements carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus are
the key building blocks of the chemicals found in living things. They form the carbohydrates,
nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids (all of which will be defined later in this chapter) that are the
fundamental molecular components of all organisms. In this chapter, we will discuss these
important building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the atoms of different elements
affect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life.
Food provides an organism with nutrients-the matter it needs to survive. Many of these critical
nutrients come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life.
These macromolecules are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules. What
specific types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules
formed? What functions do they serve? In this chapter, we will explore these questions.
